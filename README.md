## About Medbay
MedBay is a new website that will help you find the right doctor or hospital for you. It will not only show you where they are located but also show you their specialities. The website has a database of several doctors and hospitals. You can filter by speciality, and location to find the perfect match for your needs. Doctorsâ€™ blogs are a great way for patients to stay up-to-date with the latest medical news. They also help doctors share their knowledge with others who might not be in the medical profession or have access to doctors as easily as others do. Medbay has a one-page spread on how to find out if you have Covid-19 and how to book an appointment. The website also has a list of FAQs on the page. MedBay also has an online booking system that provides an easy way to book appointments with doctors. Patients can fill out the form on the website, and then they will be automatically booked for their appointment with their doctor.
