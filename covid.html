      <p>Know more about the causes and symptoms of CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)</p>
      <article>
        <h3>What is Coronavirus?</h3>
        <p>
          Coronaviruses are a common group of viruses; while some
          coronaviruses affect only animals, a few others can also affect
          humans. It is very likely that all of us have been infected by
          coronavirus at some point in our life. The symptoms of a coronavirus
          can range from a mild cold to flu like symptoms to moderate and
          severe upper-respiratory infections. The SARS epidemic (severe acute
          respiratory syndrome) was also caused by coronavirus. Coronavirus is
          also known to affect the gut and hence some patients may suffer from
          diarrhoea.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>The current situation is caused by COVID 19.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Coronavirus infections typically spike up during winter months as
          the virus can thrive in cold temperatures. So, people typically
          suffer from cold due to coronavirus in the months that are cold. The
          immunity is short lived and so we fall prey to cold and flu again.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3>How does COVID – 19 spread?</h3>
        <br />
        <div class="bullets">
          <div>
            <li>Currently COVID – 19 is spreading from people to people</li>
            <li>
              The infection spreads through small droplets from the nose or
              mouth from the infected person when he/ she coughs or exhales
            </li>
            <li>
              One may directly get infected from this or may also get infected
              when these droplets land on surfaces and objects.
            </li>
          </div>

          <div>
            <li>
              When you touch infected surfaces and objects, the infection is
              spread to you
            </li>
            <li>
              That is why it is important to avoid touching your face – this
              greatly increases the chance of infection.
            </li>
            <li>
              People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from
              a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
              Therefore, it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet)
              away from a person who is sick.

                heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious

                To touch light switches or elevator buttons, use your knuckle

                Avoid grasping the door handles of bathrooms and commercial

              <li>
                Always cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard it

            In perfectly healthy individuals the coronavirus infection may go
            away with minor symptoms. Coronavirus can be tested with a nasal
            swab or a blood test. Currently the testing for Coronavirus is
            undertaken by select government institutions including the AIIMS
            and National Institute of Virology, Pune.

            In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing
            seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more
            severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history
            with your healthcare provider.

            People with no respiratory symptoms, such as cough, do not need to
            wear a medical mask. WHO recommends the use of masks for people
            who have symptoms of COVID-19 and for those caring for individuals
            who have symptoms, such as cough and fever. The use of masks is
            crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of
            someone (at home or in a health care facility). People who are
            infected with COVID 19 or have flu like symptoms should wear a
            mask so that they do not spread the infection. Masks help in
            keeping the droplets in but does not help in keeping the droplets
            out. That is, if you are healthy and using a mask, you are at more
            risk to carry an infection than if you are not wearing a mask.

          What are the treatments for coronavirus infections?

        <div id="faq-six">
          <p>
            There is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19. Medical
            care can help to relieve the symptoms. Antibiotics do not work
            against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19
            is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics
            should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of
            COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to
            treat a bacterial infection. If you are not in an area where
            COVID-19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of
            those areas or have not been in close contact with someone who has
            and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently
            low. However, it’s understandable that you may feel stressed and
            anxious about the situation. It’s a good idea to get the facts to
            help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take
            reasonable precautions.
